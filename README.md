        - This column begins with a text input box to type in a movie title 
        - The search can be executed by clicking a search button or pressing the Enter key
        - Once submitted, the movie column will populate with the appropriate information for the movie title that was searched
        - If the movie title that was searched is not valid, a notice will be displayed for the user: "Title not found, please enter another movie"

    - Food:

            - The first is for the user's city and state location
            - The second is for the user's zipcode
        - There is also a dropdown menu containing different types of food for the user to choose from
        - Upon filling in the location information and choosing a type of food, the food column will be populated with the pertinent information for food delivery in the user's area
        - If there is no food delivery option for the given location and style, a notice will be displayed for the user: "Awww! No Restaurants In Your Area Deliver!"
